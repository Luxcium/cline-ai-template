## Markdown Standards

The project uses markdownlint to enforce consistent markdown formatting. Always check the "Workspace Problems" section for markdownlint warnings before and after editing files. Follow these key rules:

### Headers

- MD001: Heading levels should only increment by one level at a time
- MD022: Headings should be surrounded by blank lines
- MD023: Headings must start at the beginning of the line
- MD024: Avoid multiple headings with the same content
- MD025: Only one top-level (H1) heading per document
- MD041: First line in file should be a top-level heading

### Lists

- MD004: Use consistent unordered list style (asterisks)
- MD005: Maintain consistent indentation for list items at the same level
- MD007: Use consistent unordered list indentation
- MD030: Include spaces after list markers
- MD032: Lists should be surrounded by blank lines

### Spacing

- MD009: No trailing spaces
- MD010: No hard tabs, use spaces
- MD012: No multiple consecutive blank lines
- MD031: Fenced code blocks should be surrounded by blank lines
- MD047: Files should end with a single newline character

### Code and Links

- MD034: No bare URLs
- MD038: No spaces inside code span elements
- MD039: No spaces inside link text
- MD040: Fenced code blocks should have a language specified
- MD042: No empty links

### Tables

- MD055: Consistent table pipe style
- MD056: Consistent table column count
- MD058: Tables should be surrounded by blank lines

This file evolves naturally as Cline learns more about the project and user preferences. It should not be forced but should grow organically through experience.
